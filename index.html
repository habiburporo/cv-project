             <h3>Garment Factory</h3>
             <h5>2021-2022</h5>
             <p> Whether you are aiming for a career change or opting for a better job opportunity, you will need to provide certain documents corresponding to your previous employment. Amongst these crucial documents, the Experience Letter is an essential one which you will be asked about by your new employer. Leaving an organization without taking the experience certificate is similar to bidding adieu to your school without taking your degree certificate. An experience letter plays a decisive role in shaping your future employment career. Often referred to as a service certificate, this blog brings a detailed guide on what an experience letter is, its format as well as useful samples. </p>

In simple words, an experience letter is an official form of documentation given by a supervisor or employer with their truest knowledge of the time an employee has spent with the company. An experience letter is framed in a manner that the individual’s experience and skills are mentioned by their reporting manager. Also, it also consists of valuable feedback from the supervisor or head of the company. </p>
